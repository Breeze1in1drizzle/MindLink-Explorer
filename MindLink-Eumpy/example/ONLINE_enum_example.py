  This is an example for processing enum fusion algorithm in ONLINE dataset using the function in ../algorithm_implement/enum_tool script
  Note that the dataset's format should be same as the format performed in 'dataset' folder
  The ONLINE dataset contains 40 trials for each subject.
  In this example, for each subject, 20 trials are for training whereas the other trials are for testing.
