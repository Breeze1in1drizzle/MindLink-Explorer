  This is an example for processing EEG data in MAHNOB_HCI dataset using the function in ../algorithm_implement/face_tool script
  Note that the dataset's format should be same as the format performed in 'dataset' folder
  The MAHNOB_HCI dataset contains 20 trials for each subject.
  In this example, a leave-one-out cross validation is performed for each subject.
  This is an example for leave-one-trial-out cross validation
