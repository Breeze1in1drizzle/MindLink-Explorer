    This is an example of handle EEG data in ONLINE dataset, whose EEG features have been preprocessed.
    the shape of 'EEG.npy' stored an array with shape (60, 85)
    60 represents 60 seconds, the origin dataset is 128Hz and we get the average for each feature to avoid noise.
    85 represents 85 feature for each second. The meaning of each feature was presented in paper.
    The DEAP dataset contains 40 trials for each subject.
    In this example, for each subject, 20 trials are for training whereas the other trials are for testing.
